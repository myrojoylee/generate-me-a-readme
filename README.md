![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

- This assignment introduced us to Node.js JavaScript runtime environment. We learned how to create an application that can be run within the terminal. We were introduced to dependencies, and npm. Inquirer was installed and used to ask questions in order to generate a professional README document for any project.

## Installation

- Node.js v16 and specifically Inquirer v8.2.4 (Type in `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the Terminal to install) is needed in order to run this application.

- As shown in the demo below, simply type into the terminal the following:
  `node index.js`
